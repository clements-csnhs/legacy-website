# csnhs-website
Website for the Clements Computer Science National Honor Society

If you want to run the website locally:
Download the files.
Make sure that you have Yarn and NodeJS installed on your machine.
Open two Command Prompts in the csnhs-website folder (there should be a yarn file in that directory).
In the first CMD, run "yarn start" to run the React website.
In the second, run "node server.js" to start the NodeJS backend, or else the points checking and support for will not work.
Open your favourite browser and navigate to "localhost:3000"

You can also open the website on any device connected to the same LAN as the hosting device.
Open cmd and run IPConfig on the host machine, and find the IP address.
Navigate to "A.B.C.D:3000" on the second device.
That's it!
